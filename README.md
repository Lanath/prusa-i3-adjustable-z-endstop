An adjustable z endstop, to be used with my modified prusa i3 x motor end:  https://github.com/elliotf/prusa3/blob/graber_parts/single_plate/output/x-end-motor.stl

This part is designed to clamp to the z smooth rod and align the *endstop switch button* with the adjustment screw on my modified i3 x motor end.

In order to install it, lift your motor-side z smooth rod up out of the top clamp, place the endstop holder below the smooth rod, then lower the z smooth rod through the clamp.

Place the z endstop in the holder such that the switch button is toward the front.  This should align the adjustment screw with the button itself.  If you have removed the endstop lever, you can use a zip tie to secure the endstop.

This part printed well with an extrusion width of 0.66mm and a height of .3mm (the same suggested settings for printing Josef Prusa's i3 parts).

This part was inspired by (but does not use anything from) the YZ endstop:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:79779
